# VHDL project

**Topics:**

* Úterní skupiny: UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) vysílač a přijímač. 

* Středa: Vysílač a přijímač Morseova kódu. 

* Čtvrtek: Časovač na intervalový (kruhový) trénink s možností nastavit počet kol, dobu kola a pauzy mezi nimi za běhu aplikace.

## Instructions

The goal of the project is cooperation in small teams, further study of the topic, design of own solutions, simulation, implementation, creation of project documentation and demonstare the results. The division of roles and tasks within the team is up to their members.

* Students work on a project in the labs during weeks 9 to 13 of the semester. The practical demonstration will take place as part of the last lab.

* Through the BUT e-learning, students submit a link to the GitHub repository, which contains the complete project in Vivado and a descriptive README file. The submission deadline is the day before the demonstration.

* Source codes for the FPGA must be written in VHDL and must be implementable on the Nexys A7-50T board in the development tools used in the laboratory during the semester.

* Make testbenches for all your new components.

* Physical implementation on FPGA is necessary, computer simulation is not sufficient.
